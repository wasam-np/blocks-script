All example user scripts have been moved to the "user-archive" directory, so they won't be
activated if you copy the entire script directory from github onto your Blocks server (e.g.,
to install the latest version of all drivers). To activate a user script, simply move it
(both the JS and TS files) from the "user-archive" to the "user" directory. Any scripts
in the "user-archive" directory will be ignored.
